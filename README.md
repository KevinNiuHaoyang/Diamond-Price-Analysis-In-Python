# Diamond-Price-Analysis-In-Python

This analysis use a classic dataset that contains diamond price and nine features.
I built three models (linear regression, decistion tree regressor, XGBoosting) to analyze the prices by their cut, clarity, color, carat,etc and predict the price of diamonds.

The features detail are listed below:
price price in US dollars (\$326--\$18,823)

carat weight of the diamond (0.2--5.01)

cut quality of the cut (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal)

color diamond colour, from J (worst) to D (best)

clarity a measurement of how clear the diamond is (I1 (worst), SI2, SI1, VS2, VS1, VVS2, VVS1, IF (best))

x length in mm (0--10.74)

y width in mm (0--58.9)

z depth in mm (0--31.8)

depth total depth percentage = z / mean(x, y) = 2 * z / (x + y) (43--79)

table width of top of diamond relative to widest point (43--95)
